# The __init__ function()-All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.Use the __init__() function to assign 
# values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

class Bio:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p1 = Bio("Himani", 20)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
